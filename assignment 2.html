 	 <p>
	 <b>
	  
	 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.<br>
	 The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.<br>
	 </b>

	</div>
    <div id="d2">
 	 <h2>HOW IT SPREADS</h2>
 	 <p>
	 <b>
			Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.<br>
